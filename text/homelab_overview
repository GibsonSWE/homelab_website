Hardware

I am currently running my home lab on an Asus MiniPC, with an Intel Core i5 13500H and 32GB of DDR5 4800MHz memory.

This MiniPC is running Proxmox as it's hypervisor, which I am deploying all of my virtual machines and containers on.



Services:

Bind9 DNS-server
This is my one and only DNS-server at the moment, handling all DNS-request in my network.


Nginx Reverseproxy
The reverse proxy will handle all incoming traffic accessing my webservers, and only expose some of my webservers to the internet.
For example this website you're looking at right now.
The reverse proxy also centralizes and manages all of my SSL certs.


Graylog logserver
My log server centralizes all system and application logs from all of my servers in one place. It also provides metrics and 
search filtering for easier troubleshooting accross my home lab.


Grafana metrics server
On my Grafana server I am visualizing metrics from some of my services and sensors in my homelab


Netbox
My Netbox server is where I document my networks and their IP-address allocation. This is probably a little bit above my needs for a homelab, 
but Netbox is a very powerful and exciting tool that I felt like I had to try out!

Home Assistant
This is my central hub for everything Home automation, from here i can control lights, chromecasts, TVs Speakers and much more.
Aswell as monitor various sensors like temp sensors, door sensors,
